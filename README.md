# SomeUnityUtils
Mostly standalone Unity utilities that I would lose if I didn't put them somewhere. Last tested on Unity 2020.1.0f.


# Taggy
Apply tags to GameObjects at runtime or through the Unity editor. You can apply multiple tags to a single object.

Search for all objects with a specific tag:
	List<GameObject> Taggy.Find(string objectsWithThisTag);
